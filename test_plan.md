# Test Plan for Unit Tests

## Critical Components Identified

1. **Data Fetching & Loading**
   - File: `lib/data.ts`
   - Purpose: Handles fetching data from multiple sources and compiling it.

2. **PHP Parser**
   - File: `lib/parsers/php.ts`
   - Purpose: Parses data to check for PHP related information.

3. **DMARC Loader**
   - File: `lib/loaders/dmarc.ts`
   - Purpose: Loads DMARC records for given domains.

## Testing Strategy

### Data Fetching & Loading
- **Test Case 1**: Verify that `fetch` function properly compiles and returns complete data for a domain.
- **Test Case 2**: Verify that loaders are called correctly and their outputs are processed as expected.
- **Test Case 3**: Verify that log messages are generated at appropriate steps.

### PHP Parser
- **Test Case 1**: Verify that the `parse` function correctly identifies PHPSESSID headers in data.
- **Test Case 2**: Verify that the parser returns correctly structured metadata for PHP services.
- **Test Case 3**: Verify that the parser returns no metadata when PHPSESSID is absent.

### DMARC Loader
- **Test Case 1**: Verify that `load` function correctly calls DNS resolve method for DMARC records.
- **Test Case 2**: Verify that the function handles DNS resolution errors gracefully.
- **Test Case 3**: Verify that the function returns correctly structured data with DMARC records.

## Tools & Frameworks

- **Testing Framework**: Jest (Assuming it's already used in the project or is compatible)
- **Mocking Library**: `jest.mock` or similar for mocking dependencies like DNS resolution functions.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Testing Environment**: Ensure Jest is installed and configured.
2. **Write Test Cases**: Implement test cases as described above for each critical component.
3. **Run Tests**: Execute tests and ensure they all pass.
4. **Review & Optimize**: Refactor any tests as necessary to improve reliability and performance.
